# Text Encryption Decryption

A simple Java application that enables users to encrypt and decrypt text using a basic cipher algorithm. This project serves as a foundational tool for understanding text manipulation and encryption techniques in Java.

## Features

- **Text Encryption**: Convert plain text into an encrypted format.
- **Text Decryption**: Revert encrypted text back to its original form.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Console-based interaction for easy use.
- **Educational Purpose**: Ideal for beginners to learn about encryption concepts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed on your system.
- A Java IDE or a simple text editor to view and edit the code.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tejas3103/Text_Encryption_Decryption.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd Text_Encryption_Decryption
   ```

3. **Compile the Java File**

   ```bash
   javac Text_Encryption.java
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   java Text_Encryption
   ```

## Usage

Upon running the application, follow the on-screen prompts to:

1. Choose between encryption and decryption.
2. Enter the text you wish to process.
3. View the result displayed in the console.

## Project Structure
